## Title:
Belly Button Biodiversity

## Description:
In this project you will find an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were 
present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
